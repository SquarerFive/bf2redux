# BF2MC and BF2 Redux (or BF2 Redux as MC is based off BF2 mechanics).

## What is this project?
We are planning on remaking Battlefield 2 and Battlefield 2 Modern Combat from scratch in a modern game engine (Unreal Engine 4).

## What are the terms of use?
Well, everyone is free to help develop this project but any vandalism is not tolerated. Additionally licenses may be held for people who create assets from scatch (which means the asset belongs to them, it may not be taken from this project to be used in another unless it is done by the creator of the asset).
